# Try Axios

Yeah, this is pretty simple; it's just a handy online tool for you to send a basic POST request using [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios).

Honestly I only use when I run it locally to test out whatever API that I want to serve on localhost. (Other people might find this useful though, so here it is!)

If you need something more advanced, use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [apirequest.io](https://www.apirequest.io/).
